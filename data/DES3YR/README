These inputs are in COSMOMC format.

lcparam*.txt files contain the redshift-binned
	     distances and uncertainties
	     Following Eqs. 14&17 of Brout et al arXiv:1811.02377
	     
sys*.txt files contain the redshift-binned
	 covariance matrix (20 bins = first row of file)
	 Computation of this matrix is defined in Eqs. 12&18 of Brout et al arXiv:1811.02377
